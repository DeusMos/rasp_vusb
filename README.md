What is it?
================================
This repo explains how to turn your Raspberry Pi Zero into USB Keyboard and Mouse. Also provides sample code and binaries to control them.

Steps - Installation
================================

1. Flash your SD card with NOOBS (download: https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/noobs/) or use your installed Raspbian.

2. Make /share directory on your raspberry pi.
    ```
    $ sudo mkdir -m 1777 /share
    ```

3. Run /script/deploy_with_pscp.bat on your PC to deploy files to Raspberry PI Zero. (download pscp.exe from https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html)
    ```
    c:\...\script> deploy_with_pscp.bat [your_raspberrypi_ip]

    For example, if the address of your raspberry pi is 192.168.0.100

    c:\...\script> deploy_with_pscp.bat 192.168.0.100
    ```

4. On your raspberry pi, make /share/install_usb.sh runnable.
    ```
    $ sudo chmod +x /share/install_usb.sh
    ```

5. Run install_usb.sh
    ```
    $ sudo /share/install_usb.sh
    ```

6. That's all, all of the changes will be applied after reboot.
    ```
    $ sudo reboot
    ```

7. Finally, connect your Raspberry PI zero to your Computer then reboot Raspberry PI zero.
    ```
    $ sudo reboot
    ```

8. For windows user, go to your "Control panel" / "Device Manager", you can find 3 new devices.
    ```
    Human Interface Devices
        * USB Input Device

    Keyboards
        * HID Keyboard Device

    Mice and other pointing devices
        * HID-compliant mouse  (Absolute position + buttons)
        * HID-compliant mouse  (Relative position + wheel)
    ```

How to Test
================================
Now, you can run "InputController.exe" on your Windows PC. As soon as run, it will find "usb_server" program which is run in Raspberry PI and connect it automatically.

At first, InputController parse input as mouse data. So you move to specific position but need to calculate. If you move to x = 50, y = 100 and your monitor's resolution is 1920 * 1080, your input has to be like this,

```
x = 50 * 32767 / 1920 = 853
y = 100 * 32767 / 1080 = 3033
```

then type it,

```
853 3033
```

you can find your mouse position is moved to (50, 100) on windows.

Also, you can move your mouse relatively. For this, type '+' or '-' prefix to number.

```
+50 -10
```

And control wheel on the mouse with 'w' prefix to offset value.

```
w10
```

it acts as scrolling down, or type "w-50" to scroll up with offset 50.

Test it as keyboard with this command,

```
--mode
```
(If you type "--mode" again, it will change to mouse input mode)

Now you can enter any text and just hit enter,

```
test is good
```

Your PC will accept "test is good" key inputs. Of cource, you can send any special inputs of these,

```
Left Window key: <window>
IME toggle key: <ime>
Enter Key: <return>
Control Down: <ctrl_down>
Control Up: <ctrl_up>
Shift Down: <shift_down>
Shift Up: <shift_up>
Alt Down: <alt_down>
Alt Up: <alt_up>
CapsLock: <capslock>
ESC: <esc>
Backspace: <backspace>
Tab: <tab>
Insert: <insert>
Home: <home>
Page Up: <pageup>
Page Down: <pagedown>
Delete: <del>
End: <end>
Left Arrow key: <left>
Right Arrow key: <right>
Up Arrow key: <up>
Down Arrow Key: <down>
F1 ~ F12: <f1> ~ <f12>
```

If you type like this,

```
test is good<backspace>d <shift_down>wow<shift_up>
```

you will see this text input,

```
test is good WOW
```


Steps - Uninstallation
================================
1. Just run uninstall_usb.sh.

```
$ sudo /share/uninstall_usb.sh
``` 

2. Reboot.
```
$ sudo reboot
``` 


How to build
================================
If you want to modify InputController.exe and rasp_vusb_server.out, just load rasp_usb.sln in Visual Studio 2017, and build it.

It needs connection info to Raspberry Pi for compiling C++ source codes to ARM machine codes.

That's all.
